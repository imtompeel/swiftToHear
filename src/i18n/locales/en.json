      "content": "It is easy to forget how deeply the Scriptures value listening. In our culture—and often in our ecclesial conversations—there is a quiet pressure to be the one who knows, who teaches, who speaks with confidence. But Scripture pushes us toward a different kind of wisdom: not the quick retort or the flawless argument, but the attentive ear."

James reminds us that hearing must come before speaking, and that anger—often the fruit of defensive or unchecked speech—does not produce the righteousness of God. Paul, writing to Corinth, describes a church fractured by immaturity—strife, factions, jealousy—and marks these as symptoms of people still driven by the flesh rather than the Spirit.",
      "content2": "It is not difficult to see parallels in our own community. We are bound together in the hope of the Kingdom and in a shared love for Scripture. But we also know the pain of fractured conversations—whether over doctrine, relationships, or ecclesial practice—where we speak past one another or fail to fully see one another."

    "practising": {
      "title": "Practising the art of listening",
      "intro1": "If we are to become mature in Christ, we must recover the art of listening—not passive silence, but active, compassionate attention. The kind of listening that Jesus often invited through his poetic and enigmatic statements. His parables, questions, and open-ended encounters called others to listen more deeply—to themselves, to him, and to the movement of God in their lives. This kind of listening slows us down, draws us out, and opens a space where the Wisdom might speak.",
      "intro2": "To that end, a small group of us are beginning to experiment with a simple practice designed to help us listen better and trust more deeply in the process of godly conversation. It centres around three roles:",
      "roles": {
        "speaker": {
          "description": "Shares what's on their heart without interruption, taking time to explore their thoughts and feelings."

          "description": "Captures key insights and themes that emerge, helping the group remember what was shared."
        }
      },
      "rotation": "Crucially, these roles rotate. Everyone becomes a speaker, a listener, and a scribe after an allotted time. No one controls the outcome. Instead, we place faith in what can emerge when we listen together in love. As Proverbs 20:5 says, \"The purposes of a person's heart are deep waters, but one who has insight draws them out.\" This practice is a way of drawing out—not just others' words, but the meaning beneath them, even those meanings hidden from ourselves.",
      "discovery": "As the conversation unfolds, it often leads us to discoveries none of us could have reached alone. As Paul reminds us in 1 Corinthians 13:12, \"For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.\" Our understanding is always partial. But through mutual listening, we begin to uncover not only what we don't know, but what we don't know we don't know—the blind spots and assumptions that only another's voice can help illuminate.",
      "faith": "This practice is not about asserting control over words or ideas, but about cultivating faith in the conversation itself—faith that when we \"submit to one another out of reverence for Christ\" (Ephesians 5:21), something deeper than individual insight can emerge. We begin, as 2 Timothy 2:24–25 teaches, to \"patiently endure,\" \"correct with gentleness,\" and leave room for \"God [to] perhaps grant them repentance leading to a knowledge of the truth.\""

      "discernment": "Some may worry that careful listening opens us to harmful or misleading ideas. But to listen is not to agree. Adam's mistake was not listening to Eve—it was obeying against God's command. Throughout Scripture, God's people are called to discern, not dismiss; to test the spirit of what is said, not to fear hearing it. Listening creates the space for such discernment. Inquiry helps us hear more exactly what is being said—so often we react not to what was truly spoken, but to a misunderstanding. The practice of attentive listening slows us down and gives space for clarification, preventing unnecessary conflict and helping the body grow in truth and love."
